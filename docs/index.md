# Getting started

To get started with the [DeepLabCut WebUI](..) you will need to have the backend running, your administrator may have already provided you with a URL for the backend, in that case follow the [User Guide](guide/select-backend.md) to learn the basics of using the web interface. Otherwise, to setup the backend yourself follow the [Setup Guide](setup/configuration.md).
