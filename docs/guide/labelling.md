Once an image has been extracted, you can begin labelling it, select the label you want to add from the sidebar, then select a point on the image. The label will be placed under your cursor, you are then free to adjust the location of the point by clicking and dragging the point to the new location.

## Showing all frames

To see an overview of all the extracted frames click the "Show all frames" button. The currently displayed frame will have a green border, and you can click on any frame to switch to it.
